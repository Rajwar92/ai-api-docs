# Advanced API Usage

Take your integration to the next level with advanced features of our AI-powered API.

## 1. Chaining Requests

You can chain multiple API calls to build complex workflows. For example, generate text and then analyze its sentiment.

### Example: Generate and Analyze

```python
import api_client
client = api_client.Client('your-api-key')

# Generate text
response = client.generate(prompt='Write a product review for a new phone', model='gpt-4')
text = response.content

# Analyze sentiment
analysis = client.analyze(text=text, tasks=['sentiment'])
print('Sentiment:', analysis['sentiment']['label'])
```

## 2. Using Webhooks

Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications for important events.

- See the [Webhooks Guide](../guides/webhooks.md) for setup instructions.

## 3. Batch Processing

Send multiple requests in parallel to speed up processing.

### Example: Batch Generation (JavaScript)

```javascript
const prompts = [
  'Summarize the latest AI trends',
  'Write a tweet about API security',
  'Generate a product description for a smart watch'
];

const results = await Promise.all(prompts.map(prompt =>
  client.generate({ prompt, model: 'gpt-4' })
));

results.forEach((result, i) => {
  console.log(`Prompt ${i + 1}:`, result.content);
});
```

## 4. Customizing Models

You can specify different models and parameters for each request. See the [API Reference](../api-reference/index.md) for details.

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

- Log all API requests and responses for debugging.
- Monitor usage and errors in your dashboard.
