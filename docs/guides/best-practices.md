# API Best Practices

Follow these best practices to get the most out of our AI-powered API and ensure your integration is secure, reliable, and efficient.

## 1. Secure Your API Keys
- Never expose your API keys in client-side code or public repositories.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults to store sensitive credentials.
- Rotate your API keys regularly and remove unused keys.

## 2. Handle Errors Gracefully
- Always check for error responses and handle them in your code.
- Use the error codes and messages provided in the API response to debug issues.
- Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient errors (e.g., 429, 500).

## 3. Respect Rate Limits
- Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header to avoid hitting rate limits.
- Implement automatic retry logic with backoff when you receive a 429 error.
- Upgrade your plan if you need higher limits.

## 4. Optimize Requests
- Only request the data you need (use filters, pagination, etc.).
- Batch requests when possible to reduce network overhead.
- Use efficient data formats and compression if supported.

## 5. Use the Latest SDKs
- Always use the latest version of our official SDKs for best compatibility and security.
- Check our [GitHub](https://github.com/example) for updates.

## 6. Monitor Usage and Logs
- Track your API usage in the dashboard.
- Set up alerts for unusual activity or errors.
- Log all API requests and responses for auditing and debugging.

## 7. Secure Webhooks
- Validate webhook signatures to ensure authenticity.
- Use HTTPS endpoints for receiving webhooks.
- Respond quickly to webhook events (acknowledge receipt, then process asynchronously).

## 8. Stay Informed
- Subscribe to our status page and release notes for updates.
- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/your-community) for support and tips.

## 9. Contact Support
- If you encounter issues, check our [FAQ](../support/faq.md) or [contact support](../support/contact.md).
