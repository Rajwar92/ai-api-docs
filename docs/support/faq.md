Our AI-powered API provides access to advanced machine learning models for text generation, image creation, and data analysis. It's designed to help developers build intelligent applications quickly and easily.

### How do I get started?

1. Sign up for an account at [our platform](https://example.com/signup)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Follow our [Quick Start Guide](../getting-started/quick-start.md)
4. Check out our [examples](../examples/javascript.md) for code samples

### What programming languages are supported?

We provide official SDKs for:
- JavaScript/Node.js
- Python
- Go
- Ruby

You can also use any HTTP client to make direct API calls.

## API Usage

### How much does it cost?

We offer several pricing tiers:

- **Free**: 1,000 requests per month
- **Pro**: $20/month for 100,000 requests
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for high-volume usage

See our [pricing page](https://example.com/pricing) for detailed information.

### What are the rate limits?

Rate limits vary by plan:
- **Free**: 60 requests per minute
- **Pro**: 300 requests per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

See [Rate Limits](../getting-started/rate-limits.md) for complete details.

### How do I handle errors?

All errors follow a consistent format with error codes and messages. See our [Error Codes](../api-reference/errors.md) documentation for complete reference.

## Models and Capabilities

### What models are available?

We support multiple AI models:
- **GPT-4**: Most capable text generation
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: Fast and cost-effective
- **DALL-E 3**: Advanced image generation
- **Stable Diffusion**: Open-source image generation

### Can I use my own models?

Currently, we only support our hosted models. Contact us if you need custom model support.

### How accurate are the responses?

Model accuracy depends on the specific task and model used. GPT-4 generally provides the most accurate responses, while GPT-3.5-turbo offers a good balance of speed and accuracy.

## Security and Privacy

### Is my data secure?

Yes, we take security seriously:
- All API calls use HTTPS encryption
- Data is encrypted at rest
- We don't store your prompts or responses
- SOC 2 compliant

### Do you store my API requests?

We temporarily log requests for debugging and abuse prevention, but we don't store your actual content or use it for training.

### Can I delete my data?

Yes, you can delete your account and all associated data at any time through your dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### My API key isn't working

Check that:
1. Your API key is correct and not expired
2. You're including it in the Authorization header
3. Your account is active and not suspended

See [Authentication](../getting-started/authentication.md) for more details.

### I'm getting rate limit errors

This means you've exceeded your plan's rate limits. Consider:
1. Upgrading your plan
2. Implementing caching
3. Using batch requests
4. Adding retry logic with exponential backoff

### The API is slow

Response times can vary based on:
1. Model complexity (GPT-4 is slower than GPT-3.5-turbo)
2. Request size
3. Server load

For faster responses, try using GPT-3.5-turbo or reducing your request size.
